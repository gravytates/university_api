- GET requests for universities and reviews

Authenticated users can access:
- POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE requests for universities and reviews

- Filters universities by name
- Filters universities by description
- Filters universities by population
- Filters universities by mascot

The application structure is outlined below.  

Models:
  - Universities
  - Reviews
  - Users (Devise Authentication)

## Database Seeding

The application is seeded using `faker`.  It seeds 20 universities and 1 review for each university.

There is one user seeded in the database with Email: "a@a.com", Password: "111111".

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)

## Installation

In your terminal:
* `git clone https://github.com/akane0915/university_api`
* `cd university_api`
* `bundle install`
* Open another terminal window and type `postgres`.  Leave this window open.
* In your first terminal window type:
* `bundle exec rake db:setup`
* `bundle exec rake db:test:prepare`

This application uses JWT Tokens.  To configure, you must authenticate the seeded user to generate a token.  In your terminal, run:

`curl -X POST -d email="a@a.com" -d password="111111" http://localhost:3000/auth_user`

You can test the API in Postman.

* URL: localhost:3000/
* Header Key: Authorization
* Header Value: 'your-own-token-goes-here'

## Calling API from another application
You can test API calls from your own application via the Rails Console.  See sample commands below for GET, PATCH, POST, and DELETE.
